Component for Slim Hamburger Menu

Created Using HTML and CSS

The code implements a slim hamburger menu, which serves as a navigation menu for users. When the menu is closed, it displays an image, providing a visual representation
for users. However, when the hamburger menu is opened, it reveals the name of the image prominently. This ensures that usershave a clear understanding of the available
navigation options associated with that image. By toggling the menu, users can seamlessly switch between viewing the image and 
accessing the navigation options represented by the image's name.
